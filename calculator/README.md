# Calculator

This is a simple calculator project.

## Usage

The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

To use the calculator, run the `main.py` file with the numbers and operators as a single string expression.

For example:

```bash
python main.py "2 + 2 * 3"
```

This will print the result of 2 + 2 * 3, which is:

```
┌─────────────┐
│  2 + 2 * 3  │
│             │
│  =          │
│             │
│  8          │
└─────────────┘
```
